# Barton Timetable Parser

In order to get started you will need python3 and nodejs installed. If you dont know how to do that I would suggest that you shouldnt be using this.

Fingers crossed all the node modules you should need are already there if not you will need to do `npm i dotenv`. You will also need to make a .env file with the parts from .env.example filled in.

Once thats all done just run `node index.js` and your timetable will be ready in json form!
